To install, it's pretty much just:

ruby install.rb

...possibly followed by:

make
make install

It will ask you whether you want the binary or ruby core. I'd recommend the former, for performance
reasons: the binary module is much faster - the difference between 12KiB/s and 4KiB/s encryption speed
(when using CBC), so only install the pure-ruby version as a last resort.

Note that if you install both, the pure-ruby one will always take precedence.
